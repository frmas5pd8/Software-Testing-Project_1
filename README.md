# Software Testing Document Template
In this repo, you will find a comprehensive collection of project were successfully accomplished during my practicing in manual testing. These projects showcase manual testing methodologies &amp; strategic use of test management tools. By exploring the repo, you'll gain insights into the diverse range of testing scenarios.
 
# Functional Requirement Specification (FRS) Report
* It is a concise and detailed document outlining the functional capabilities and features required for a software system or application. It defines how the system should behave in response to specific inputs and conditions, specifying the expected outputs. FRS serves as a blueprint that guides the development team in designing and implementing the software to meet the client's needs and expectations accurately.

# Test Scenario Document Template
* It is a specific set of test cases that collectively verify a particular aspect or functionality of a software application. It defines the conditions, actions, and expected results to test a specific requirement or feature. Test scenarios help ensure comprehensive testing coverage and aid in identifying defects early in the testing process.

# Test Cases Document Templates
* It is a detailed set of instructions or steps designed to validate a specific functionality or behavior of a software system. It includes preconditions, inputs, expected outcomes, and post-conditions. Test cases serve as executable documentation to verify that the software meets the specified requirements and performs as expected.

# Test Enviroment Document Template
* It is a dedicated setup that replicates the production environment for testing software applications. It includes hardware, software, network configurations, and databases necessary to conduct thorough testing. The test environment ensures accurate simulation of real-world scenarios, enabling testers to identify and resolve issues before the software is deployed to the production environment.

# Bug Report Document Template
* It is a document that provides detailed information about a discovered software defect or issue. It includes a description of the problem, steps to reproduce it, environment details, and any relevant attachments like screenshots or logs. Bug reports help developers understand, replicate, and fix the reported issues, contributing to the overall improvement of software quality.

#  Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) Document Template
* It is a table that links software requirements to corresponding test cases. It ensures comprehensive test coverage and helps track the validation of each requirement throughout the testing process. RTM aids in verifying that all requirements are met, fostering effective test management and alignment with project objectives.
